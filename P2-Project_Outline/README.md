## Submission Instructions

### Overview
As a working parent I often struggle to come up with some fresh, fast, and delicious meal ideas, so I felt it important to create an app that provides a platform on which users can browse and try new recipes based on their palate, time available and food preferences. Upon landing on the app/webpage users are greeted by a variety of recipes with varying difficulty and time to prepare. They can then select from those presented or browse for additional ones based on a specific main ingredient.
Additionally, some site features are reserved for account holding users. theses include  the ability to upvote their favorite recipes which results in them being saved onto their profiles for future use. They will also hold the ability to upload, edit and delete their own recipes.
